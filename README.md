# COVID-19 death analysis

This is a data science project that examines the factors that cause a COVID-19 case to result in a death.  The dataset is a sample taken from the CDC: https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data-with-Ge/n8mc-b4w4

- **Covid19_Analysis.ipynb** is the Jupyter Notebook file
- **test.csv** is the test dataset
- **train.csv** is the training dataset


This project demonstrates:
- Data exploration and wrangling
- Techniques to impute missing data
- Encoding categorical variables and standardizing numerical variables
- Building a classification model using sci-kit learn
- Optimizing model hyperparameters
- Evaluating model performance using accuracy, ROC, and AUC
- Interpretation of significant features in the model
- Data visualization
